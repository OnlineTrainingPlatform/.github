## Online Training and Assessment for Developers

A number of internet portals e.g. hackerrank [2], coderbyte [1], etc. enable developers
to improve their coding skills and allow companies to asses potential employees. A large
number of programming languages and problems are already covered. However, there
is room for other languages or tools.
In this project we explore the development of an online training and assessment
framework for some new domain, examples include: Octave, Matlab, SMT solvers, etc.
How would you create your own portal?
